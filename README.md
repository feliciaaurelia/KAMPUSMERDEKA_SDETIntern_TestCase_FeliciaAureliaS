Web automation script was made using Katalon Studio as the automation tools that I choose.
Automated testing is divided into 2 test cases, a one-time flight and a round-trip flight.
Work files are uploaded in .rar format.
Testing is carried out starting from entering the tiket.com website, choosing a flight, choosing an airline, until payment without logging in/registering.
The method I use when creating automated testing using Katalon Studio is the script method.

Here are the steps on how to run the automation script:
1. Download the file named "KAMPUSMERDEKA_SDETIntern_TestCase_FeliciaAureliaS.rar".
2. Extract file.
3. Using Katalon Studio to open the project.
4. File -> Open project -> Select Folder named "KAMPUSMERDEKA_SDETIntern_TestCase_FeliciaAureliaS".
5. Inside the test case folder, there are 2 test cases namely FlightPulangPergi_Test and FlightSekaliJalan_Test.
6. Click test case that want to be execute.
7. To see the script code, click the "script" button at the bottom of the work sheet.
8. To run the script code, click run at the top or using Ctrl + Shift + A.
9. Automated testing will be automatically running via the main browser.
